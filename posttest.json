        "question": "For a 4-bit parallel adder, if the carry-in is connected to a logical HIGH, the result is __________",
        "answers": {
          "a": "The same as if the carry-in is tied LOW since the least significant carry-in is ignored",
          "b": "That carry-out will always be HIGH",
          "c": "A one will be added to the final result",
